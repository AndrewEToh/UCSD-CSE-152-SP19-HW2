    "## Problem 1: Stereo and Disparity [3 pts]\n",
    "Consider two cameras whose (virtual) image planes are the z=1 plane, and whose focal points are at (-20, 0, 0) and (20, 0, 0). We''ll call a point in the first camera (x, y), and a point in the second camera (u, v). Points in each camera are relative to the camera center. So, for example if (x, y) = (0, 0), this is really the point (-20, 0, 1) in world coordinates, while if (u, v) = (0, 0) this is the point (20, 0, 1).![Fig1.png](fig/fig1.png)\n",
    "a) Suppose the points (x, y) = (12, 12) is matched to the point (u, v) = (1, 12). What is the 3D location of this point?\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Consider points that lie on the line x + z = 0, y = 0. Use the same stereo setup as before. Write an analytic expression giving the disparity of a point on this line after it projects onto the two images, as a function of its position in the right image. So your expression should only involve the variables u and d (for disparity). Your expression only needs to be valid for points on the line that are in front of the cameras, i.e. with z > 1."

    "### Image Rectification \n",
    " An interesting case for epipolar geometry occurs when two images are parallel to each other. In this case, there is no rotation component involved between the two images and the essential matrix is $\\texttt{E}=[\\boldsymbol{T_{x}}]\\boldsymbol{R}=[\\boldsymbol{T_{x}}]$. Also if you observe the epipolar lines $\\boldsymbol{l}$ and $\\boldsymbol{l^{'}}$ for parallel images, they are horizontal and consequently, the corresponding epipolar lines share the same vertical coordinate. Therefore the process of making images parallel becomes useful while discerning the relationships between corresponding points in images.\n",
    " Rectifying a pair of images can also be done for uncalibrated camera images (i.e. we do not require the camera matrix of intrinsic parameters). Using the fundamental matrix we can find the pair of epipolar lines $\\boldsymbol{l_i}$ and $\\boldsymbol{l^{'}_i}$ for each of the correspondences. The intersection of these lines will give us the respective epipoles $\\boldsymbol{e}$ and $\\boldsymbol{e^{'}}$.  Now to make the epipolar lines to be parallel we need to map the epipoles to infinity. Hence, we need to find a homography that maps the epipoles to infinity. The method to find the homography has been implemented for you. You can read more about the method used to estimate the homography in the paper \"Theory and Practice of Projective Rectification\" by Richard Hartley.\n",
